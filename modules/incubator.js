        What is the Ruby Incubator Program? <br />
        If you are a software engineering or computer science student and youâ€™re
        interested in a career in web development, we offer a program of support
        and progress to help you grow into this capability. This program is
        offered by the Kennedy Technology team to help bridge the gap and help
        people become capable with web software development skills, as this is a
        growing and promising field. The program is self-paced, and participants
        will be in charge of their participation in the program. We will provide
        resources, check-in calls, mentoring, community support, and more for
        participants as they develop the skills for a career as a web software
        developer.
