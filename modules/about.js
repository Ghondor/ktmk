      <h2> Origin </h2>
      <p>
        Samuel Kennedy, based in New York, has worked in the field of technology
        and startups for over 15 years. Prior to founding Kennedy Technology,
        Sam was the founding engineer then Vice-President of Technology at Slice
        for over seven years. Having the history and background of working with
        a back-office team in Macedonia, the thought of starting a small
        technology team there became a compelling opportunity. Founded in 2018,
        Kennedy Technology is forming a small but dedicated team of software
        engineers, applying technology to solve real world problems and to build
        great businesses. Our focus is to partner with early stage startups,
        launching new web and mobile products while growing our team and skills.
